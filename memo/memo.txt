1) What are the necessary preprocessing steps regarding:
a) classes ? no preprocessing needed, already binary feature

b) categorical features ? for multicategorical features, creation of dummy variables

c) continuous features ? standardization

2) Confusion matrix:
a)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed with a Heart disease (false positives) ? 5

b)How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)? 12


3) Changing the threshold:
a)What is the precision if we change the threshold to have a 0.95 recall ? 0.48

b) How many patient were incorrectly diagnosed as being Healthy (false negatives)? 2



4) Choosing an overall metric:

a) If I can compute my test sample probabilities and care more about the positive class, which overall metric should I use to compare classifiers ? average precision (AUC precision-recall)

b) And if I only have the class predictions and no probabilities ? f1
